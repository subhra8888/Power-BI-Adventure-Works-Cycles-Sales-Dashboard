## Insights
* Approximately $24.9 million in revenue and $10.5 million in profit was generated between 01/01/2020 and 30/06/2022. There is an appreciable dip in revenue between 01/06/2020 and 01/11/2020 (possibly due to the simulated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), after which revenue appears to grow linearly. December 2021 was an exceptional year in terms of revenue at $1.64 million, and it would be worth investigated the cause of this. Was this due to a highly successful seasonal campaign, e.g. a Black Friday promotion?
* Understandably, tires and tubes are the most ordered product type, while cycling shorts are the most returned product type. After mountain bike fenders, sports helmets top the list of revenue-generating products, despite having relatively high return rates:
